# calculator-demo

🧮 WPF Calculator App : This is a simple yet functional calculator application built using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) as part of the Advanced Programming Methods course at the university I study at, Universitatea Transilvania Brasov.
The project demonstrates a clean application of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, along with basic handling of practices in WPF UI development.

🔧 Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- More complex operations, like %, square root, and squaring
- Partial implementation of Programmer mode
- Memory functionality: MC, MS, MR, M+, MView
- Clear and backspace functions
- Error handling (e.g., divide by zero)
- Clipboard functionality to cut, copy and paste any numbers from the calculator

  🎯 Educational Focus
  - Mastering the basics of C# and WPF
  - Learning how to create an UI in XAML
  - Getting accustomed to the MVVM pattern

   📁 Technologies Used
  - C#
  - WFP (XAML)
  - MVVM
 
💡 What To Expect In The Future : Just because I've turned in this project does not mean I'm finished working on it! I believe any project can be perfected through hard work and perseverance and wish to further improve my application by adding:
- Keyboard input support
- A complete Programmer mode implementation (LShift, RShift, the ability to execute operations with numbers in other bases other than base 10)
